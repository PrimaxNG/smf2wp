## Welcome to SMF2WP

Now you do not have to be stuck with SMF forum alone anymore and probably do not have to pay too high to have a minimal conversion of your SMF posts
into Wordpress. SMF2WP does just that for you.


### How it works?

Assumptions: It is assumed that both the smf_messages table and the wordpress posts/comments tables are in the same Database before this Migration

Here is how it works in 3 simple steps;
```markdown


1. Open settings.php and update the dbname, tables names and other fields.
2. Load up smf2wp index.php and Fire the Convert button
3. Check your Wordpress Application

NOTE: If your database is connected properly, you will see your posts count on both database before and after the migration.

```

Good Luck!

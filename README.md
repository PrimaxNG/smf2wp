## Welcome to SMF2WP

Now you do not have to be stuck with SMF forum alone anymore and probably do not have to pay too high to have a minimal conversion of your SMF posts
into Wordpress. SMF2WP does just that for you.


### How it works?

Here is how it works in 3 simple steps;
```markdown


1. Create your MSF Database connection
2. Create your new Wordpress Database Connectiooon
3. Load up smf2wp index.php and Fire the Convert button


NOTE: If your database is connected proper;y, you will see your posts count on both database before and after the migration.

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

###Good Luck!
